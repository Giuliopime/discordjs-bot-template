# 💾 Discord.js Bot Template
This is a simple Discord bot template which uses [discord.js-light](https://github.com/timotejroiko/discord.js-light#readme) 
to reduce memory usage which can be a big deal when using [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/).  

The bot has some handy built-in features which are described in the next section.

## 🎛 Features
- [Dynamic event handler](src/core/event-handler)
- [Command handler](src/core/command-handler)
- [Commands cooldown system](src/core/utils)
- [Permissions checking system](src/core/discord-utils)
- [Tip system](src/core/utils/tips)
- [Logger](src/core/utils)
- and more...

Everything is described in its respective folder inside the `/src` folder which contains all the bot's code.
